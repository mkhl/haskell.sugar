## Installation

### For Users

In the directory containing this file, run the command

	python setup.py py2app

This will build the sugar in the `dist` folder. `Open` it and Espresso will
take care of installing it in the right place.

### For Developers

In the directory containing this file, run the command

	python setup.py py2app -A

This will build a developer version of the sugar in the `dist` folder. You
should then install a symlink to it in the Espresso Sugar folder
(`~/Library/Application Support/Espresso/Sugars`). You can now modify any of
the files in the source tree and relaunch Espresso to load the modified
versions.
